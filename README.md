# OOP_5
Code using static class member and destructor. 

The class College which has private data members name, numberOfDepartments, and numberOfFaculty. It has public member functions set(), get( ), print(), and a default parameterized constructor (with default values “DCS” as a name, 5 departments, 10 faculty). The class also has static data members count (to keep track of the number of objects instantiated from class College), and totalNumberOfFaculty (to keep track of the total number of faculty of all objects). The class has a member function departmentDensity() which computes the faculty density in each department (number of faculty in a college divided by the number of departments in that college), a member function getCount() to return count, a member function getTotalNumberOfFaculty() to return total number of faculty in all instantiated objects, and a member function avgFaculty() which computes the average number of faculty per a university (total number of faculty divided by the number of colleges).
A university is made of a number of colleges, and so the class College can instantiate a number of colleges and the function avgFaculty() can be used to find the average of faculty in all colleges.
